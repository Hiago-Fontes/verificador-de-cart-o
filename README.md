### Card-Validator ðŸ’³
Credit card number validator implemented in C, based on the Luhn Algorithm. The program takes a card number as input, checks its format (length and digits), performs the validation calculation, and identifies the card brand (AMEX, MasterCard, or Visa). If the number is invalid, it displays "INVALID." This project is ideal for practicing conditional structures, loops, functions, and number manipulation in C.
